1- Using only NumPy and Pandas libraries implemented a Neural Network from scratch:
Created the network architecture with input, hidden, and output layers based on the input-output shape.
Defined an activation function.
Implemented the FeedForward process.
Implemented the BackPropagation algorithm.
Implemented the Train and Test functions.
2-   Tested the model on the MNIST Dataset.
       Calculated the confusion matrix and the accuracy of your model.
